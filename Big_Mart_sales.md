# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that can forecast `Item_Outlet_Sales` based on historical data. We explore different predictive modeling techniques to improve forecasting accuracy, leveraging both simple and complex models to draw insights and make reliable predictions.

### Objective

The primary goal is to predict the sales for different items in various outlets using the dataset. We will attempt multiple models, starting with a basic mean-based approach, and eventually explore group-based means for improved prediction accuracy.

### Dataset

The dataset contains sales records for different outlets. Key columns include:
- `Item_Identifier`: Unique product code.
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`: Target variable representing sales for the item in the outlet.
- `Outlet_Type`: Type of the outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket Type1).

### Problem Definition

- **Goal**: Predict sales (Item_Outlet_Sales) based on historical data.
- **Owner**: Retail Data Science Team
- **Success Criteria**: Achieve low prediction error, measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Constraints**: Missing values and potential data noise.
- **Actors**: Data scientists, analysts.
- **References**: Based on the provided dataset and standard predictive modeling processes.

### Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and check for missing values.
2. **Data Shuffling**: Randomize the dataset to remove any order-based biases.
3. **Training and Test Split**: 75% of data is used for training, 25% for testing.
4. **Simple Mean Prediction**: A basic approach where the mean sales are used for prediction.
5. **Outlet Type-Based Prediction**: Predict sales based on the mean of outlet type sales.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of models is compared using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
